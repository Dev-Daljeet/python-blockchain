# python-blockchain

This project is a simple blockchain built using Python. With this script, user can create their own cryptocurrency. 

**Note: My primary goal with this project was to learn the basic concepts of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency generated with this script could not meet the present market demands for a stable, secure, and easy-to-use cryptocurrency.**
